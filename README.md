## Description

Our team is housed in Bangladesh, USA ,Spain and comprised of talented individuals with experience in various industries. We have developed Dynamic Inventory using technologies such as React, Javascript, and MongoDB. We have experience migrating data from legacy systems to our web-based software. We don’t back down from a challenge, and have yet to come across a problem we couldn’t solve with a little code and a lot of coffee. Our assembly line approach to software development has driven our success.

## Project details down below:

- This is Warehouse based Website.
- Warehouse use for Smartphone.Collecting many kind of phone from different mobile companies.
- There is a 5 types of different companies where we are collecting our phone (Xiaomi, Realme, Samsung, Google, Oppo).
- Describes some of details about our Warehouse.
- Used firebase authentication for the login form.
- Used JWT(JSON Web Token) to more secure our data.
- Used React route,firebase authentication,tailwind components,react hot toast and many more.

## List of libraries

1. React (Javascript Library)
2. Tailwind (Css Library)
3. Flowbite (Tailwind Components Library)
4. Firebase-authentication-hooks (Firebase Library)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
