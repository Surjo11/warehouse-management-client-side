        About Us
      </h1>
      <p className="text-xl">
        Our team is housed in Bangladesh, USA ,Spain and comprised of talented
        individuals with experience in various industries. We have developed
        Dynamic Inventory using technologies such as React, Javascript, and
        MongoDB Tomcat. We have experience migrating data from legacy systems to
        our web-based software. We don’t back down from a challenge, and have
        yet to come across a problem we couldn’t solve with a little code and a
        lot of coffee. Our assembly line approach to software development has
        driven our success.
